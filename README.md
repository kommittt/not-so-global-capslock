# i am going insain
uhhh yeah cool shit
i probably wasted so much time for this only for absolutely no one to use this

# trial thing
since everything needs your credit card these days to function properly, this might be gone after 30 days, so november 13-ish
i think it will continue running since this doesnt take much resources, but im not sure!! dont expect it to be alive for long

# i did not fully code this
gpt basically did everything related to the server because i do not know jack shit about websocket!!!!!!!!!!!
the html however is made by me, thats the only thing i know doing
